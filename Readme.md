BookCompare: An app for comparing book prices to help you find the best deal online. Also for posting your own book listings for sale.

Testing instructions:
Since it's camera-dependent, this app has to be tested on an actual phone (not in the simulator). It's built for iPhones and not iPads.
Decent lighting conditions are ideal, although the scanner is pretty tolerant. Some aren't in the API, so try a couple more if the first one or two book barcodes you attempt to scan aren't recognized by the app.
In addition to scanning books and viewing (dummy) prices, the app also allows for adding your own listings and revisiting your scan history. Tapping on a row in the price tables after a scan also begins composing an email for you to send to the selected seller. I encourage you to try out all these features. List some cool books for sale!
